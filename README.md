# Weather App

A simple, modern Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Enter your city to get real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon that matches the current conditions.

## Features

- Search for weather by city name
- Displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed
- Dynamic weather icons (sun, cloud, rain, drizzle, mist)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern UI

## Demo

Open `index.html` in your browser and try searching for any city!

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone or Download** this folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How it Works

- Uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch real-time weather data.
- Updates the UI with temperature, city, humidity, wind speed, and a relevant weather icon.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
